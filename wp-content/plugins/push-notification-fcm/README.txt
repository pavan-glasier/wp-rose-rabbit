Simple FCM plugin for push notifications on Android & iOS devices. Easy integration, REST API endpoints for device registration & more!

== Description ==

Introducing you a simple and easy-to-use framework plugin for Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) primarily intended for Android and iOS developers, that allows you to send push notifications to all Android and iOS devices worldwide. With our plugin, integration and use are a breeze.

Simply install the plugin, enter your Firebase Server (API) key in the settings, generate a site key, and select the types of posts for which you want to send notifications. 

Our plugin also includes REST API endpoints, which are used to register and deregister devices with your site when the mobile application is launched or deleted. Once a device is registered, it will receive notifications every time a new article or page is published in the selected post types. Don't miss out on important updates, try our FCM plugin today!

= REST API Endpoints =

In order to send push notifications to a device, the device's unique identification (ID) and token need to be recorded in the site's database. To accomplish this, the plugin provides two REST API endpoints: one for subscribing a device when the mobile application is installed or launched, and another for unsubscribing a device when the application is deleted. These endpoints allow the site to keep track of which devices are registered to receive notifications and which are not.

**Subscribe device:**

`https://example.domain/wp-json/fcm/pn/subscribe`

**Parameters:**

* `rest_api_key` (required) - Unique generated site key provided by the plugin
* `device_uuid` (required)
* `device_token` (required)
* `subscription` (required) - This would be the some category name in which the device is registered, if there is no category exists in WordPress itâ€™ll be created automatically.
* `device_name` (optional)
* `os_version` (optional)

**Returns JSON:**
`
{
	"error": false,
	"message": "Device token registered",
	"subscription_id": 123
}
`

**Unsubscribe device:**

`https://example.domain/wp-json/fcm/pn/unsubscribe`

**Parameters:**

* `rest_api_key` (required) - Unique generated site key provided by the plugin
* `device_uuid` (required)

**Returns JSON:**
`
{
	"error": false,
	"message": "The device token was successfully removed"
}
`

This plugin is a free and open-source software, which means that it can be used in any WordPress installation without any cost and can be modified as per the requirement.
